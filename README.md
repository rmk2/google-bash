# google-bash

This repository provides a basic implementation of Google OAuth and some
Google API calls.

It is written almost exclusively in bash (inline Python2 for json parsing
doesn't count, does it?!).

## Installation

Download from <https://github.com/rmk2/google-bash>.

## Usage

### oauth.sh

If you put the file somewhere on your `$PATH`, run:

	$ oauth.sh +-f ARG [+-l ARG] [+-d ARG] [--] ARGS...
	
Otherwise, prepend the path to where the script is located.
